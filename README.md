# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various data structures and algorithms problems, including daily coding challenges from platforms like freeCodeCamp and HackerRank.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, improve my problem-solving skills, and apply these concepts in practical coding scenarios. The repository is a mix of Python and JavaScript solutions.

## Highlights

Here are a few examples of the problems I've solved:

-   **`2025_10_30_nth_prime.py`**: A Python script to find the nth prime number.
-   **`2025_11_05_fcc_daily_matrix_builder.py`**: A Python script to build a matrix of a given size.
-   **`2025_11_07_fcc_daily_counting_cards.py`**: A Python script for a card counting problem.
-   **`2025_08_26_decode.js`**: A JavaScript solution for a decoding problem.

## How to Run the Code

To run any of the solutions, you can execute the Python or JavaScript files directly.

For Python:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

For JavaScript:

```bash
node <filename>.js
```
